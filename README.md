# StreetCleaning

second project for an introduction to AI

about multi-agent

Goals include:

1. render(by 5.18)
2. coordination between moving objects(by 5.21)
3. communication between agents(by 5.24)
4. maximize cleaning efficiency(by 5.29)
5. explore nn(by 6.5)

There are two different settings in this project:

1. The first one is to simulate daytime cleaning, where the agents are supposed to clean the streets while cars and pedestrians are moving around. The agents are supposed to avoid collisions with cars, and they are supposed to clean the streets as efficiently as possible.
2. The second one is to simulate nighttime cleaning, where there are no obstacles on the streets. The agents are supposed to clean the streets as efficiently as possible.

For the first setting, run Render.main.py
For the second setting, run DRL.MAA2C.py
